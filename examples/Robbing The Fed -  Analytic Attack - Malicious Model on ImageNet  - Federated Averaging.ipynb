This example deviates from the other \"honest-but-curious\" server models and investigates an actively malicious model. As such, the attack applies to any model architecture, but its impact is more or less obvious (or not at all) depending on the already present architecture onto which the malicious \"Imprint\" block is grafted.\n",
